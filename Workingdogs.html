    <strong>The list of jobs</strong> that humans ask dogs to perform is almost endless. In the thousands of years since dogs were
    domesticated, canine helpers have guarded homes, rescued people in danger, gone to war, and looked after the sick and disabled, to give
    only a few examples. In this book, the working group is represented by breeds traditionally developed for pastoral work and guard duties. </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <div class="columns">
        <p>>In general, the dogs in thie highly diverse group tend to be large, though there are a few small but nonetheless robust exceptions.
            Working dogs are bred for strength and stamina, and many of them are capable of living outdoors in all weathers. A collie rounding up its 
            flock is for most people the archetypal shepherd dog, but many other types of dog are used to work with livestock. These pastoral breeds,
            as they are known, are used for both herding and guarding. Herding dogs have a natural instinct for driving stock, though not all of them 
            work in the same way. Border Collies, for example, keep their sheep in order by stalking and staring, while the traditional cattle herders such 
            as Welsh Corgis and the Australian Cattle Dog nip at heels, and some herders bark as they work. Guardian sheepdogs, which include mountain breeds 
            such as the Maremma and Great Pyrenees, are designed to protect their flocks from predators such as wolves. Usually very large, many of these dogs 
        are white and heavy-coated, scarcely distinguishable from the sheep they spend their lives guarding. Guard duties of another kind are often carried out by
        dogs of the mastiff type, recognizable as descendants of the enormous Molossus dogs seen in friezes and artifacts from the ancient world. Such breeds as 
    the Bullmastiff, the Dogue de Bordeaux, and the Neapolitan are used worldwide by security forces and for guarding property. Typically, these dogs are massively
     built and powerful, with small ears (often cropped in countries where the practice is still legal) and penulous lips. Many working breeds are excellent as companion dogs.
    Pastoral herders are extremely intelligent and generally easy to train and oftenenjoy using their skills in agility trials and other canine competitions. Livestock guardian dogs,
because of their sheer size and protective nature, are less likely to be suited to family life. In recent decades, a number of the mastiff-type breeds have achieved great popularity as 
companions. Although some were produced originally for fighting, if reared in the home and socialized early, they can adapt to life as a pet.</p>

            <p style=height:300px;width:450px;><strong>Robust and powerfully built,</strong> the Giant Schnauzer from southern Germany was originally used for farm work and cattle herding.
            By the 20th century, the breed's intelligence, trainability, and impressive appearance had been recognized as ideal qualities for a guard dog.
        This breed is now widely used by police and security forces, but an equable temperament also makes it suitable as a home watchdog and pet. Despite its size, the Giant Schnauzer is
         easily manageable if given plenty of exercise. Its dense, wiry, double-layered coat needs regular maintenance, with daily grooming and an occasional trim.</p>
