    <strong>Canine speed demons,</strong> the sight hounds - or gazehounds as they are sometimes called - are hunting dogs that locate and follow their prey
    primarily by using their keen eyesight. Streamlined, lightly framed, but powerful, a sight hound in pursuit of quary moves face and turns with great flexibility.
    Many dogs in this group were bred to hunt specific prey. </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <div class="columns">
    <p>As shown by archaeological evidence, lean, leggy dogs have been hunting alongside humans for thousands of years, but the early
    development of modern sight hounds is not entirely clear. It is likely that many crosses involving a diversity of other breeds, 
    including terriers, went into the creation of classic sight hounds such as the Greyhound and the Whippet. Most sight hounds are easily 
    recognizable as a type. Selective breeding has developed characteristics designed to promote speed: strong, supple backs and an athletic build
    enable the body to stretch out at full gallop; long-striding, elastic limbs and powerful hindquarters provide impulsion. Another characteristic
    is a long, narrow head that either lacks a pronounced stop or, as in the case of the Borzoi, has no stop at all. Typically, in a sight hound 
    bred to hunt and snap up small prey, the head is carried low when the dog runs at full stretch. Another common feature of sight hounds is a deep chest 
    accommodating a larger than usual heart and allowing for good lung capacity. Short or fine silky coats tend to be the norm among this group of dogs; only
    the Afghan Hound is very long-haired. Graceful and aristocratic, sight hounds during their history have been the favored hunting dogs of the wealthy and wellborn.
    Greyhounds, or at least coursing dogs very similar to the modern breed, were kept by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Salukis were, and occasionally still are,
    used by sheikhs for hunting gazelle in the desert. In pre-Soviet Russia, the spectacular Borzoi was the dog of choice for the nobility and even royalty, specifically
    bred for running down and killing wolves. Today, sight hounds are used for racing and coursing and are very often kept as pets. Usually nonaggressive, although
     sometimes a little aloof, sight hounds make attractive family dogs but need handling with caution when outdors and may be best exercised on a leash. Their instinct to chase 
     small animals can be strong enough to override all obedience training. A sight hound chasing after what it perceives to be prey is almost impossible to stop.

developed in the UK, the breed's earliest ancestors may have been the similar - looking dogs depicted in Egyptian tombs dating back some 4,000 years BCE. Originally bred to hunt hare, today, these dogs are raced
for sport. As a pet, the Greyhound needs only moderate daily exercise and is happy lounging around at home the rest of the time.

<p><strong>The fasted domesticated animal</strong> for its weight, the Whippet is capable of speeds of up to 35 mph (56 kph). It has impressive 
    powers of acceleration and can twist and turn at speed with dexterity. This elegant little dog was developed in the north of England in the late 19th century by crossing the Greyhound
with various terriers. Originally bred for hunting hare, rabbit, and other small game, the Whippet soon became popiular as an affordable sporting dog. Whippet racing, held whereever there was enough
space for dogs to sprint a few hundred feet, became a regular fixture for working men of mill and mining towns. Today, it is still used for racing, as well as lure coursing and agility trials, but is 
mostly kept as a pet. Quiet, docile, and affectionate, the Whippet behaves well in the house and is gentle with children. A sensitive breed, it needs tactful handling and is easily distreseed by rough play or 
harsh commands. With its delicate skin and short, fine hair, the Whippet needs to wear a coat in cold weather. Its own coat is almost odor-free, without a "doggy" smell even when wet. Puppies with long coats 
are occasionally born but are not officially recognized. The Whippet has abundant energy and should be given regular exercise and, in safe areas, plenty of opportunity to run free. It is generally good with other dogs 
but has a strong hunting instinct and chases cat and small animals if given the chance. A Whippet will tolerate-or at least ignore-a household cat if the two are raised together, but it should not be left unsupervised
with other family pets, such as rabbits or guinea pigs. This breed is wary with strangers, so it makes a reasonable watchdog. Toward  its owners, the Whippet shows unswerving loyalty.

<p><strong>This large, frilly-haired, almost feline dog</strong> is arguably them most aristocratic of sight hounds. Once known as the Russian Wolfhound, it was bred 
to hunt wolves for czars and nobles; often, over 100 of these dogs would chase wolves through the snowbound tundra. Outside Russia, the Borzoi has been bred for many years 
for companionship. Today, the dog is happy in a regular home environment but needs plenty of long walks and runs. It also requires a routine of brushing and bathing to keep
 its long, wavy coat lustrous.</p>
