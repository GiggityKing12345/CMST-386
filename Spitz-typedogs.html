        <strong>A team of huskies</strong> pulling a sled over ice wastelands epitomizes the type of known as a Spitz. In fact, this group has diverse uses, 
    including herding, hunting, and guarding; many smaller types are kept solely as pets. Descent from wolves is apparent in many spitz dogs: the shape
of the head, the typical wolf coloring, and an alert expression. </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <div class="columns">
       <p>Many of the modern spitz breeds seen today originated in northern Arctic regions, though a number of them - including the Chow Chow and Akita - were developed in East Asia.
       The history of the spitz group remains unclear, but it is currently thought they originated in Asia, some migrating alongside tribal movements into Africa and others across 
       the Bering Strait to North America. Breeds such as the Greenland Dog and Siberian Husky were used most famously for sled-hauling by the polar explorers of the 19th and 
       early 20th centuries. These tough dogs worked in appalling weather conditions, often on a diet of poor food, and frequently ended up being eaten themselves when their owners ran out of rations.
       Such spitz-type sled dogs were also one widely used by North American hunters and fur trappers. Today, the sled-hauling spitz breeds are popular for endurance racing and with tourists who want to try their 
       hand at dog-driving. Other spitz dogs have been bred for hunting large game, such as wolves and bears, and for herding reindeer. The Akita, originally from Japan, was developed as a fighter and bear hunter and now
       oftern works as a guard dog. Among the small, nonworking spitz dogs are the Pomeranian, selectively bred down in size from a larger type of dog, and the newly created Alaskan Klee Kai, a miniature husky. Spitz dogs,
        both large and small, have teh characteristics of animals bred specifically for living in extremely cold climates. Typically, they have a very thick double coat, which varies in length and density according to the 
        origin of a breed. Other features for preventing heat loss in low temperatures are pointed, densely furred ears and well-furred feet. An attractive addition to many breeds is the distinctive "spitz" tail that curls upward over the back.
        As house dogs, most spitz breeds are happy with family life, but they are not the easiest of dogs to train. Without sufficient exercise and amusement, they can resort to disruptive behavior such as digging holes and barking.

<p style=height:200px;width:450px;><strong>Long used as a sled dog</strong> by the indigenous peoples of eastern Siberia, the Siberian Husky has great endurance, 
an appetite for work, and resistance to extreme cold. The breed is still popular in the Arctic, particularly in sports such as dogsled racing. Siberian Huskies
 make peaceable and lovable companions but need vigorous exercise to burn off some of their energy. They have a strong pack instinct and are unlikely to be happy 
 living in isolation. A Siberian Husky tends to see small animals as natural prey, so caution is needed if other pets are kept.</p>

</a>
<p><strong>The wolflike Alaskan Malamute</strong> is named after the Native American Mahlemut people, who bred these
dogs to pull heavy loads and travel great distances across the snow when sleds were the only mode of transportation. Today, it is still used to haul freight in remote North American
locations and successfully takes part in sled-racing competitions. Also used on polar expeditions, this breed has staggering amounts of stamina, strength, and tenacity combined with
 higly tuned sense of direction and smell. For all its toughness, the Alaskan Malamute is a friendly dog, at least toward people, which means that it cannot be relied on as a guard dog. 
 It likes children but is too ig and boisterous to be left alone with a small child. The Alaskan Malamute, especially the male, tends to be intolerant of strange dogs, and without thorough
  socializing can quickly become aggressive. The breed also has a strong chasing instinct and can disappear far and fast in pursuit of small animals that it sees as prey. Owners should be 
  cautious about where and when to exercise this dog off leash. A quick learner, the Alaskan Malamute settles well into domestice life as long as it has  at least 2 hours of exercise each 
  day and outdoot space to roam in. A bored dog with energy to sparecan be destructiveif left at home alone without supervision. Although its thick coat sheds in spring, there is a risk of 
  overheating if the dog is overexercised in hot weather, so it needs access to shade.</p>
