<strong>Before the advent of firearms,</strong> hunters used dogs to help them locate and chase game. With the introduction of guns, a different 
type of dog was required. Gundogs were developed to carry out specific tasks and to work more closely with the hunters. The breeds fall into several categories
based on the type of work they were bred to perform.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
<div class="columns">
<p>The dogs in the gundog group, which hunt by scent, are classified broadly in three main divisions: the pointers and setters, which locate prey;
the spaniels, which flush game out of cover; and the retrievers, which collect fallen prey and bring it back to the hunter. Breeds that combine these functions are known
as HPR (hunt/point/retrieve) dogs and include the Weimaraner, German Shorthaired Pointer, and the Vizsla. Pointers have been used as hunting dogs since the 17th century.
They have the extraordinary ability to indicate the location of prey by "pointing" - freezinginto position with nose, body, and tail aligned. A pointer remains motionless until the 
hunter either flushes out the game or instructs the dog to do so. The English Pointer, which features in many old sporting portraits alongside hunting squires and their "bags" of game birds,
is a classic example of the type. Setters also direct attention to game by freezing. Typically used to hunt quail, pheasant, and grouse, these dogs crouch, or "set", when they pick up a scent.
Originally, setters were trained to work with hunters who caught game with nets while their dogs prevented the prey from making an escape on the ground. Spaniels drive out, or flush, game birds,
forcing them to take wing into the line of the guns. They watch where a bird falls and are usually sent to retrieve it. This division includes small, silky-coated, long-eared dogs, such as the Springer
Spaniel and Cocker Spaniel, used or finding game on land,, and less familiar breeds, such as the Barbet and the Wetterhound, which specialize in flushing waterbirds. The retrievers were bred specifically 
for retrieving waterflow. In common with some breeds of the spaniel division, these gundogs often have water-resistant coats. They are renowned for their "soft" mouths and quickly learn to carry game without 
damaging it.

    </a>
    <p><strong>This classic gunddog</strong> is so called because it was originally used to "spring" game - startle birds in the air. Spaniels
    used as gundogs were once classified according to their size: the larger dogs (called Springers) were used for flushing game and the smaller 
    ones for flushing woodcock. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the English Springer Spaniel was not recognized as an official breed, although
    it had developed into a distinct type known as the Norfolk Spaniel. The English Springer Spaniel will work with hunters in the field all day, undeterred by
rough terrain or adverse weather conditions, even jumping into freezing water when necessary. This breed is a popular choice with game shooters, but its friendly,
biddable disposition makes it an excellent family dog, too. It likes company, including children, other dogs, and the household cat. If left alone for too long, 
it may resort to excessive barking. A nonworking dog needs long, energetic daily walks and will enjoy having a stream to splash in, mud to roll in, or toys thrown for it 
to retrieve. This breed is bright and willing to learn and will respond to calm authority. Is it highly sensitive, so giving harsh or loud commands is likely to be counterproductive.
The English Springer Spaniel's love of the outdoors means that it needs weekly groominh to prevent its thick coat from becoming matted and dirty and regular trimming, especially of 
the long feathering on the ears and legs. There are two types of English Springer Spaniel: working and show. Dogs bred specifically to work in the field tend to have their tails docked and be
slightly smaller and of lighter build than dogs produced for showing. Both types makes equally good companion dogs.</p>
