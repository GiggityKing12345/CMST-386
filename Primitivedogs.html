    <p style="border: 0.5em solid green; color:darkmagenta; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; "><strong>Most modern dog breeds</strong> are the result of many years of selective breeding for particular characteristics, but a few,
    commonly regarded as primitive dogs, have remained close to the original "blueprint" of their wolf ancestors. As a group, primitive dogs 
    are not clearly defined, and not all authorities agree that such a category should be recognized. 
    </p>
    <div class="columns">
    <p> As variously listed, primitive dogs are a diverse group, but many of them share typically wolflike characteristics.
        These include erect ears, a wedge-shaped head with a pointed muzzle, and a tendency to howl rather than bark. Their coats are usually short 
        but vary in color and density according to the region from which the dog originates. Most primitive dogs come into season only once a year, unlike other domestic
        dogs, which have two cycles of estrus a year. Canine specialists are now taking an interest in dogs that have had little to do with humans and nothing to do with breed
    development programs. These primitve dogs, which come from verious parts of the world, include the Carolina Dog of North America and the rare New Guinea Singing Dog, which is genetically
close to the dingo of Australia. Such dogs have evolved naturally rathen than through breeding for temperament of appearance and cannot be considered completely domesticated. The New Guinea Singing
Dog, which is highly endangered in the wild, is more likely to be seen in zoos than in homes. Several dogs are included in the primitive group because they are believed to be uninfluenced by any other
types over thousands of years. Among them is Basenji from Afric, long used for hunting in its native country before becoming a popular pet. Other examples are hairless dogs from Mexico and South America,
 genetic mutations of coated breeds that resemble dogs depicted in the art and artifacts of anicient civilizations. Recent genetic investigations suggest that two dogs included in this section-the Pharoah 
Hound and the Ibizan HOund-should should no longer be considered primitive. These breeds are popularity supposed to be the direct descendants of big-eared Egyptian hounds pictured in drawings dating back 
5,000 years. However, there is genetic evidence that the line of descent may not have remained unbroken down the centuries. It is probable that the Pharoah and Ibizan Hounds are in foact modern recreations
 of a primitive dog type.</p>

         <p><strong>This rare dingolike breed</strong> is a native of New Guinea, where it lives feral or in semiidomestication. 
            The Singing Dog is kept as a curiousity in zoos worldwide but has become a challenging pet for a few dedicated owners. 
            It has the extraordinary ability to vary the notes of its howl, hence the name.</p>

         </a>
         <p><strong>A hunting dog from Africa</strong>, the Basenji was used for driving big game, locating its prey by both sight and scent. Sleek and beautifully built with an immaculate appearance, the Basenji is affectionate and fun-loving and is a popular
        house dog. Unable to bark, it can, however, make yodeling noises.</p>

        <p><strong>Bred in Israel as a watchdog and herder</strong>, the Canaan Dog has strong protective instincts that do not usually turn into aggression. It is highy intelligent and with steady training makes a reliable and affectionate companion. Not a common breed,
        it has yet to achieve widespread popularity.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;color:rgb(46, 156, 247);background-color: darkviolet;">PHARAOH HOUND</h2>

            <p><strong>Although the modern Pharaoh Hound</strong> was developed in Malt, this graceful breed bears a strong resemblance to the prick-earred hunting dogs illustrated in the art and artifacts
            of ancient Egypt. The Phraoh Hound is calm tempered but needs a lot of exercise and, unless restrained outdoors, will fly off in pursuit of small animals, including other pets.</p>

            <p><strong>Also known as the Podenco Canario, this hound-found on all the Canary Islands- has Egyptian roots dating back thousands of years. The breed has long been used as a
                rabbit hunter and is highly valued for its speed, keen sightm and excellent nose. Sensitive and restless, the Canarian Warren Hound is unable to adapt to a quiet life indoors.

            <p><strong>This Silicilian breed</strong>, which may well have originated in the area immediately around Mount Etna, is rare outside its native country. Lithe and strong, the Cirneco dell'Etna
            is built to run and hunt. Although good-natured, this dog is not an ideal option for owners who want a placid house pet. </p>

            <p><strong>Used in Spain as a pack dog</strong> for hunting rabbits, the Ibizan Hound can cover the roughest ground at a "ranking trot" characteristic of the breed.
            This dog also has an enormous jump and can easily leap over a garden fence. As long as an owner bears security in mind, the Ibizan Hound is not difficult to keep, but it is an all-action dog that 
        needs relentless exercise. The breed has a charming temperament and fits in well with family life. There are two coat types - smooth and rough - both of which are easy to maintain.</p>

            <p><strong>Commonly known as the Portuguese Warren Hound</strong>, this breed  has developed into several varieties with distinct differences in size and coat. 
            Today's dogs may be small (pequeno), medium (medio), or large (grande), and some are smooth-haired while others have moderately long, wiyt coats.
            All were tradionally used for hunting, and in Portugal some are still kept for that purpose, working wither in a pack or alone. Regardless of size, their intelligence and alertness
        make them excellent watchdogs.</p>

            <p><strong>Also known as the "American Dingo,"</strong> this dog's ancestors are thought to have been domesticated and brought into North America by early settlers from Asia.
            In America's southeastern states, some still live semiwild. Naturally wary, this dog needs early socializing to make it an acceptable pet.</p>

            <p><strong>Records of hairless dogs</strong> in South America date back to pre-Inca times. It has been suggested that this lively and graceful breed may have originated in China or Africa
            before it was introduced in Peru. Hairlessness- often accomplished by the absence of certain teeth - is produecd by a particular recessive gene, but occasionally, coated dogs do occur in litters. 
        The Peruvian Hairless breeds come in three sizes: miniature, medio, and grande. The fine skin needs some protection,  because these dogs are susceptible to the cole and easily sunburned.</p>

            <p><strong>In pre-Conquest Mexico</strong>, hairless dogs were believed to have sacred signifance and were often used as a sacfrifice or ritually eaten in religious ceremonies. Because of these practices,
            hairless dogs barely escaped extinction, and it was not until the mid-20th century that breeders began to work towerd its recovery. Three different sizes are now recognized. Like all hairless dogs, this breed has limited general appeal and ramains something of a rarity.
        Nonetheless, the Xoloitzcuintli, also known as the Mexican Hairless, is charming, good-tempered, and intelligent and is likely to reawrd its owner with loyalty and affection.</p>
