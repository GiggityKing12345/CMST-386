        <strong>A keen sense of smell</strong> is an essential part of being a dog. The sharpest noses belong to the scent hounds, which track
    prey more by following scent than by using hteir eyes as the sight hounds do. These dogs, some of which hunt in packs, have a natural ability
to pick a trait, even if it is days old, and will follow it single-mindedly. </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <div class="columns">
    <p>It is not known exactly when certain dogs were first recognized for their exceptional ability to hunt by scent. The origins of the modern scent hound
    possible date back to the mastiff-type dogs of the ancient world, brought into Europe by traders from the region that is now Syria.
    By the Middle Ages, hunting with packs of scent hounds was a wiidespread and popular sport, the quarry including fox, hare, deer, and wild boar. Pack hunting
    arrived in North America in the 17th century, with English settlers who brought their own foxboounds with them. Scent hounds come in all sizes but typically 
have subsantial muzzles packed with odor-detecting sensors; loose, moist lips that also aid scent detection; and long, pendant ears Bred for staying power rather 
thanspeed, they are strong-bodied, especially in the forequarters. The breeds of scent hound known today were selectively developed not only according to the size of prey
that they followed but to the countryside that the hunts covered. The English Foxhound, for example, is comparatively fleet and lightly built for leading a mounted hunt over mostly open terrain.
Similar in general appearance but much smaller, the Beagle hunted hare, sometimes in thick undergrowth, with followers on foot. Some short-legged dogs were bred to follow or dig out quarry below ground.
The best known of these small scent hounds is the Dachshund, an agile little dog adept at getting in and out of tight spots. The Otterhound, which hunted its quarry in rivers and streams, sometimes
 swimming for much of the time, has a water-repellent coat and more extensive webbing between its toes than most dogs. With a widespread ban on hunting with hounds in the UK, the future of breeds such 
 as the English Foxhound or Harrier is uncertain. Although usually gregarious and good with other dogs, pack hounds rarely make satisfactory house pets. They need space, are often vocal, and their eagerness
to follow any scent trail can make them difficult to train.

    Hound) may have been among the dogs brought to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. Massive, wrinkly, and droopy-eared, this is the classic sleuthhound of detective stories.
The Bloodhound is renowned for its superlative trackiing abilities over varied terrain and can pick up a scent that is several days old. Good-natured and mild-mannered, this dog is also an excellent
family companion for those with room to spare.</p>

    <p>As its name suggests, this shaggy-coated hound was once used for hunting otters. Though its exact origins are uncertain, 
        dogs of a similar type working in packs were known in England from about the 18th century, and there are records of otter hunting with pack hounds as far back as
    the 12th century. When otters became a protected species and otter hunting was banned in the UK in 1978, the number of Otterhounds declined sharply. The breed is now considered
rare, with fewer than 60 puppies being registered by the Kennel Club each year. Small numbers of Otterhound is a strong, energetic dog that, given sufficient exercise, readily adapts to 
life in the home. It is intelligent and good-natured but, as is the case with many former pack hounds, can be difficult to train. Being large and boisterous, the breed is not recommended for 
small homes or families with elderly members of young children, because there is a risk of them being knocked over. The Otterhound is best suited to owners who enjoy outdoor activities and have
a large yard or access to open spaces where the dog can run safely. Bred for hunting in water, this hound loves swimming and will splash around happily in streams for hours, if given the opportunity.
The Otterhound's dense, coarse coat is slightly oily, and thereforewater-repellent. Regular grooming is usually enought to keep the long topcoat free from tangles; in wet weather, mud tends to 
collect but can b brushed out easily when dry. The dog's longer facial hair may need washing occasionally.</p>
