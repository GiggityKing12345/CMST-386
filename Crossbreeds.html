        <strong>Before the advent of firearms,</strong> hunters used dogs to help them locate and chase game. With the introduction of guns, a different 
        type of dog was required. Gundogs were developed to carry out specific tasks and to work more closely with the hunters. The breeds fall into several categories
        based on the type of work they were bred to perform.</p>

            <div class="columns">
                <p>The dogs in the gundog group, which hunt by scent, are classified broadly in three main divisions: the pointers and setters, which locate prey;
                the spaniels, which flush game out of cover; and the retrievers, which collect fallen prey and bring it back to the hunter. Breeds that combine these functions are known
                as HPR (hunt/point/retrieve) dogs and include the Weimaraner, German Shorthaired Pointer, and the Vizsla. Pointers have been used as hunting dogs since the 17th century.
                They have the extraordinary ability to indicate the location of prey by "pointing" - freezinginto position with nose, body, and tail aligned. A pointer remains motionless until the 
                hunter either flushes out the game or instructs the dog to do so. The English Pointer, which features in many old sporting portraits alongside hunting squires and their "bags" of game birds,
                is a classic example of the type. Setters also direct attention to game by freezing. Typically used to hunt quail, pheasant, and grouse, these dogs crouch, or "set", when they pick up a scent.
                Originally, setters were trained to work with hunters who caught game with nets while their dogs prevented the prey from making an escape on the ground. Spaniels drive out, or flush, game birds,
                forcing them to take wing into the line of the guns. They watch where a bird falls and are usually sent to retrieve it. This division includes small, silky-coated, long-eared dogs, such as the Springer
                Spaniel and Cocker Spaniel, used or finding game on land,, and less familiar breeds, such as the Barbet and the Wetterhound, which specialize in flushing waterbirds. The retrievers were bred specifically 
                for retrieving waterflow. In common with some breeds of the spaniel division, these gundogs often have water-resistant coats. They are renowned for their "soft" mouths and quickly learn to carry game without 
                damaging it.
