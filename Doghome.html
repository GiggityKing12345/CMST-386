<p>
    to domestic companion has been greatly influenced by human intervention.
    It has taken just a few hundred years to produce seemingly endless variations
    on the canine theme, but planned breeding has not removed the basic characteristics
    of the dog's ancestor: the wolf.

'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;color: aquamarine;"><u>Evolution of the dog</u></h3>

    
    <p>All dogs share a common ancestor: the gray wold. While this
     relationship is fairly apparent in breeds such as the German Shepherd 
     or spitz-type dogs, with their wolflike heads and pricked ear, it is hard 
     to see the connection between wolves and Toy Poodles or Saint Bernards.
     Genetically, however, any dog of any breed is virtually identical to the wolf.
     The transition from wolf to the huge diversity of domestic dogs know today happened
     relatively quickly. The process began gradually, with random changes in font-size and shape, but 
     accelerated when humans began to selectively breed those dogs that 
     exhibited characteristics they desired  </p>

    Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;color: aquamarine;  ;"><u>In from the Wild</u></h3>
<p> Gray wolves and dogs diverged between 15,000 to 40,000 years ago, but when and where they developed
    a close relationship with humans is unclear. DNA evidence for domesticated dogs has been found in 
    several locations in Asia and Europe; the timing varies from 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, which 
    suggests that domestication events may have occured more than once and in different areas. The oldest 
    remains known to be domesticated dogs date back to around 14,000 years ago and comprise human-dog burials from 
    the Middle East and Asia also exist, but whether these are fossils of domesticated dogs remains uncertain.
    There are alternative theories about how dogs became domesticated. Some scholars believe that wolves scavenging around early
    human encampments were killed for their meat and skin; their orphan pups were taken in and reared in captivity
    and were found to be valuable as hunters and protectors, beginning the process of domestication. Others question
    why humans would want to domesticate a large predator that would compete with them for food. They suggest that wolves
    were more trusting of humans and could learn and adapt to human behavior, and so in part may have domesticated themselves.
    Over subsequent generations, this led to physical developments(such as drop ears) and behavorial changes(such as 
    increased friendliness) to encourage humans to fulfill their needs. Hundreds of years passed before deliberate
    breeding became more sophisticated-selecting for coat type, color, temperament, and specialized skills-eventually creating
    hundreds of different breeds. The selection process have altered over the years, and while certain characteristics fall 
    out of favor, others become embedded in the breed standard.

<h4>Information from the dog DNA</h4>
<p class="importanttext">
  In the past, the history of a dog breed was pieced together from written records, pictures, and information handed down from
   past vreeders and owners. Today, the analysis of DNA (the hereditary template found in body cells) has also made it possible
   to track the inheritence of features such as size and coat color and to look at the differences and similiarities between one 
   breed and another. Most importantly, looking at DNA has made it possible to identify which breeds are at risk of specific genetic diseases
   and conditions. Scientists sequenced the first complete dog genome in 2005 using the DNA of a boxer.

    <div class="columns-beta">
        <p>The physical characteristics of a dog are typical of a predator whose survival relies on efficiency in locating and catching prey.
            Humans have done much to adapt canine design, but the basic anantomy of all breeds of dog is the same. The skeleton of the dog evolved
            to provide speed, strength, and maneuverability. A highly flexible spine and freely moving forelimbs allow a dog to move with a long,
            swinging stride. The most important characteristics of a dog's skeleton are seen in the legs. The two large forearm bones, the radius and the unla
            are locked together in such a way that a dog can make rapid changes of direction without the bones rotating and breaking. In a further adaptation, two
            of the wrist bones are fused together- unlike the seperate bones seen in humans- to give a dog strength and stability when in a straight line.
            Combined with long, powerful toes, with claws like spikes on running shoes. this limb arrangement gives a dog a high degree of control whether 
            it is running, jumping, or turning.
            Classified as carnivores, dogs are anatomically adapted to eat primarily meat-although, given the opportunity, domestic dogs will eat almost anything.
            A dog's teeth are designed to deal with tough foods such as hide, flesh, and bone. Four large canine teeth at the front of a dog's mouth are used for grabbing
            and biting prey, while the sides of the jaw include specially modified teeth, the carnassials, which the dog uses for shearing off meat. Digs have a spacious 
            stomach for the storage of large quantities of food and, since meat can be digested rapidly, a short inestinal tract. Dogs have a wide-angled field of vision
            that functions best at long distance, and they are extremly sensitive to movement. Out of the cornver of an eye, a dog can pick up the flicker of a rabbit a hundred
            feet away, but at close range, canine vision is less efficient, which is why a dog may fail to spot a toy on the ground in front of his nose. Dogs have little
            use for sophisticated color vision and their eyes have far fewer color-receptive cells than those of humans. 
            Sharp hearing and the ability to pinpoint the direction of sounds is essential to wild hunting dogs. Breeds with erect ears shaped like those of the wolf are likely
            to have more acute hearing than breeds with drop ears, which rely more on sight or scent when hunting. A dog's highly sensitive ears allow it to pick up sounds at a 
            far higher frequency than can be heard by humans. Small is the most important of all canine sense. Sniffing is the way a dog reads its surroundings and the area of the brain that 
           interprets smells is around 40 times larger than the corresponding area in a human brain. Dogs' noses are packed with far more scent-receptive cells than humans; while a person has an 
           estimated 5 million scent receptors, a small dog may have closer to 130 million. In breeds renowned for their scenting ability, such as hounds the number of scent receptors may be as maneuverability                   as 200-300 million.
            Unlike humans, dogs do not have sweat glands in their skin except on the bottoms of their paws. To cool down, dogs must pant, tongue hanging out. The tongue produces copious saliva, some of which
                   evaporates, so this helps reduce body temperature. </p>

                  <p><img src="images/Dog_heads.jpg.jpg" width="100" height="100" >All canine heads are variations of three basic shapes. The majority of dogs have a mesticephalic head, in which
                      length and width are of mediumm proportions. A dolichocephalic head is long and narrow, with a barely noticeable stop.
                      Brachycephalic heads are broad basaed and short in length.

            <h1>Ear types</h1>
            
                  <p><img src="http://olddoghaven.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/graphic-ear-care.jpg" width=100px height=100px>Pricked, sensitive, wolflike ears-the original canine shape- occur in many breeds of dog, but centuries of planned selection have created
                      a large variety of other ear shapes. There are three main types: erect, semierect, and drop. Within these categories are many variations,
                      such as the type of erect ear known as candle flame. Ear types are often the defining characteristic of a dog group; for example, scent hounds usualy have long, pendant ears.
                      Ears strongly influence a dog's overall appearance. The correct set, shape and carriage of the ears are considered very important in recognized breeds and are described precisely 
                      in official breed standards.
                  </p>
                
                  <h1>Coat Varities</h1>
                  <p>The majority of dog breeds have a double coat like their wold ancestor. This usually consists of an insulating layer of soft, dense hair covered by a 
                      harsher outer coat of varying lenght and texture. A few thinner-coated breeds, such as greyhounds, have just a single layer of hair (no undercoat). In some breeds, chance genetic mutation
                      has produced dogs that are either completely hairless or have just a few strands of hair on the head and legs.
