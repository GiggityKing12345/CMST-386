        <strong>Almost any dog can provide companionship.</strong> Many dogs once used for outside duties, such as herding, have moved indoors ith the family. Usually, these breeds have been
    developed for specific tasks, so they are traditionally grouped according to their primary function. With a fe exceptions, the companion dogs included here are bred solely as pets. </p>

    <p>Most compaion dogs are all small breeds created primarily to sit on laps, look decorative, and entertain their owners with taking up much room. Some of them are toy versions of larger working
    breeds. The Poodle, for example, once used for herding or for retrieving waterfowl, was bred down in size to a toy dog theat could no longer perform and practical function. Other, larger dogs sometimes grouped
    with companion breeds include the Dalmation, whose career included a short-lived spell as a carriage escort, as much for prestige as guard duty. Now that this job no longer exists, Dalmatians are rarely used for any working purpose.
    Companion dogs have a long history. A number of them originated thousands of years ago in China, where small dogs were kept inthe imperial courts as ornaments and a sourceof comfort. Until the late 19th century, companion dogs everywhere
    were almost exclusively the pampered pets of the wealthy. As such, they often featured in portraits, depicted sitting prettily in the drawing room or with children as a nursey plaything. Some, such as the King Charles Spaniel, owe their
    enduring popularity to the former patronage of royalty. Appearance has always mattered in the breeding of companion dogs. Over the centuries, selective breeding has produced characteristics, some bizarre, that serve no useful function but are designed
    to appeal - for example, the humanlike flat face and large, round eyes of the Pekingese and the Pug. Some have extravagantly long coats, curly tails, or - in the case of the Chinese Crested Dog - no hair at all, apart from a few strategically place tufts 
    on the head or legs. In modern times, companion dogs are no longer a symbol of class. They find a place with owners of all ages and circumstances, in small apartments, as well as large country homes. Although still chosed for their looks, these dogs are also sought
    after as friends that give and demand affection and adapt happily to family activities.
